**AttendancePro** is a desktop application that uses **computer vision** to automate the attendance process.  
It scans faces through a webcam, verifies them against a registered student database, and logs attendance automatically — **completely hands-free**.

I originally built **AttendancePro v1.0** during my **12th grade (Commerce + Computer Science)**.  
Now, **v2.0** is a complete rewrite with a modern dark-themed UI, visual analytics, and a clean, modular architecture.

## 👨‍💻 The Story Behind This Project

> *"My goal is to become an AI/ML Engineer.  
> My strength lies in Computer Science and understanding the logic behind the magic."*

I started my academic journey in the **Commerce stream**, but my interest in logic, programming, and automation gradually pulled me into the world of technology.

I spent nearly **6 months** building this project from scratch to deeply understand how **OpenCV**, **machine learning concepts**, and **databases** interact in real-world applications.  
AttendancePro became my personal playground for learning Python and AI fundamentals, and it now forms a strong base for my journey in **Integrated MSc (AI/ML)**.

## 🧩 The Logic Behind the Magic

``` mermaid
graph TD
    Start((Launch App)) --> Dash[🏠 Dashboard]
    Dash --> Nav{User Action}
    Nav -- Add Student --> Form[📝 Enter Details]
    Form --> Cam1[📸 Capture Face]
    Cam1 --> Train[⚙️ Train Model]
    Train --> Save[(💾 Save to DB)]
    Nav -- Take Attendance --> Cam2[📹 Webcam]
    Cam2 --> Detect{Face Detected?}
    Detect -- Yes --> Log[✅ Mark Attendance]
```

## 🚀 What's New in v2.0

The second version focuses on transforming a learning project into a **professional desktop application**.

- 🎨 **Modern User Interface** — Built using CustomTkinter with dark mode support  
- 📊 **Visual Analytics** — Attendance trends displayed using Matplotlib graphs  
- 🗄️ **Zero-Setup Database** — SQLite eliminates the need for external database installation  
- 🧩 **Modular Architecture** — Clean separation between UI, logic, and database layers  
- 🔊 **Voice Feedback** — Spoken confirmation when attendance is successfully marked
